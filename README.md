Anime Classification with CNN

In this project, we developed a model that classifies anime genres from poster images, utilizing deep learning techniques and transfer learning. We built a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and used k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we apply transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet50 model. We also evaluate the effectiveness of Auto Keras, an AutoML system, in creating a model that can effectively classify anime posters.
